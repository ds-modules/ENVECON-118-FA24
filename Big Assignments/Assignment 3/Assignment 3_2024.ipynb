    "# Assignment 3 - Due Friday, October 25 at 11:59 PM\n",
    "## EEP/IAS 118\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this exercise was used in two papers, one paper by Ebonya Washington, \"Female Socialization: How Daughters Affect Their Legislator Fathers' Voting on Women's Issues\", published in the American Economic Review in 2008 that asks whether having daughters influences the voting behavior of members of the US Congress. The hypothesis is that having (more) daughters makes legislators more likely to vote liberally (in terms of political alignment, and in contrast to conservatively) on issues concerning women. The second paper by Donald Green, Oliver Hyman-Metzger, Gaurav Sood and Michelle Zee, \"Revisiting a Natural Experiment: Do Legislators with Daughters Vote More Liberally on Womenâ€™s Issues?\" published in Journal of Political Economy: Microeconomics in 2023 revisits this argument, expanding the analysis to Congresses before and after those studied by Washington. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will focus on votes that took place in the 96, 108th, 116th Congresses, which held session in 1983/1985, 2003/04 and 2019/2021. As a measure of a liberal voting record, we use scores assigned by the American Association of University Women (AAUW), a liberal group that concerns itself with issues of interest to women. For all Congresses, the AAUW selects a different number of pieces of legislation in the areas of education, economic equality, civil rights and reproductive rights. The AAUW then assigned a score to each member of Congress. The scores range from 0 to 100 and measure the percentage of times the legislator voted in favor of the position held by the AAUW.\n",
    "\n",
    " The dataset `legislators_2024.dta` contains the following characteristics for all members for all Congresses between 1985 and 2021:\n",
    " \n",
    " * $ngirls$ number of daughters\n",
    " * $nboys$ number of sons\n",
    " * $nchildren$ total number of children\n",
    " * $born$ birth year \n",
    " * $female$ indicator for being female\n",
    " * $party$ party represented in Congress (D, R or NA) \n",
    " * $aauw\\_voting$ AAUW score\n",
    " * $congress$ the Congress session for which scoring was assigned\n",
    " * $year$ year the Congress started"
