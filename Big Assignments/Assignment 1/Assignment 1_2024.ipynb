    "There is a large literature in macroeconomics that investigates why there exist such large differences in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita between developed and developing countries. Recently economists have focused on the role of agriculture in accounting for these differences (Restuccia et al. 2008, _Journal of Monetary Economics_). Why might agriculture be important? The poorest countries allocate 86% of their employment to this sector, as compared to only 4% in the richest countries, and it represents a large share of their GDP."
