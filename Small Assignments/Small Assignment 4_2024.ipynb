Suppose that male legislators are less likely to be asked about how many children they have and when they are asked about their children, they are more likely to report a erroneous number. How does this measurement error affect the estimate we calculated ($\\beta_4$) on the effect of children on AAUW scores, both in terms of bias and precision?
